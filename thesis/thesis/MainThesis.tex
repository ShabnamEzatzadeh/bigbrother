% csm-thesis automatically includes the following packages:
%% float
%% setspace
%% geometry
%% graphics
%% textcase
%% subfig

% Note: Two package options exist for your convenience: ``insane'' and ``nolabel''.  To use these options together separate them by a comma, ie. \usepackage[insane,nolabel]{csm-thesis}
% * \usepackage[insane]{csm-thesis}
% Turn off all document sanity checks.  This option can be used to render a ``sub-document'' that is part of the root thesis document.  It is important to note that you should NEVER disable this check on your root thesis document, as important format errors and warnings will be disabled.
% * \usepackage[nolabel]{csm-thesis}
% Disables automatic reference ``labeling'' of figures and tables.  By default the thesis template prepends any reference to a figure or table with ``Figure~'' or ``Table~''.  This option is meant for disabling the labeling behavior when a document already has the appropriate labeling.  It is important to note that if your document DOES NOT have the appropriate labeling (the reference label must EXACTLY MATCH the caption label) then it will not pass the format review.

\begin{abstract}
Forecasting the occupancy of buildings can lead to significant improvement of smart heating and cooling systems. Using a sensor network of simple passive infrared motion sensors densely placed throughout a building, we perform data mining to forecast occupancy a short time ($i.e.$, up to 60 minutes) into the future.  Our approach is to train a set of standard forecasting models to our time series data.  Each model then forecasts occupancy a various horizons into the future.  We combine these forecasts using a modified Bayesian combined forecasting approach.  The method is demonstrated on two large building occupancy datasets, and shows promising results for forecasting horizons of up to 60 minutes.  Because the two datasets have such different occupancy profiles, we compare our algorithms on each dataset to evaluate the performance of the forecasting algorithm for the different conditions.
