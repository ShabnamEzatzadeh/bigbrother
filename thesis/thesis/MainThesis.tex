% csm-thesis automatically includes the following packages:
%% float
%% setspace
%% geometry
%% graphics
%% textcase
%% subfig

% Note: Two package options exist for your convenience: ``insane'' and ``nolabel''.  To use these options together separate them by a comma, ie. \usepackage[insane,nolabel]{csm-thesis}
% * \usepackage[insane]{csm-thesis}
% Turn off all document sanity checks.  This option can be used to render a ``sub-document'' that is part of the root thesis document.  It is important to note that you should NEVER disable this check on your root thesis document, as important format errors and warnings will be disabled.
% * \usepackage[nolabel]{csm-thesis}
% Disables automatic reference ``labeling'' of figures and tables.  By default the thesis template prepends any reference to a figure or table with ``Figure~'' or ``Table~''.  This option is meant for disabling the labeling behavior when a document already has the appropriate labeling.  It is important to note that if your document DOES NOT have the appropriate labeling (the reference label must EXACTLY MATCH the caption label) then it will not pass the format review.

\begin{abstract}
Traffic forecasting can lead to significant improvements for controls systems.  Most forecasting models retain accuracy under normal daily conditions.  However what happens when a forecasting model encounters an anomaly?  In this work we include both human occupancy traffic through two different buildings and vehicle traffic on the Denver roadways.  We focus primarily on improving forecasting accuracy during the presence of repeated anomalies.  Our approach is to train a set of standard forecasting models to our time series data.  Clustering and modeling the worst case forecasts of these forecasting models yields a number of potential anomalies.  We then introduce a novel technique to combine all of these potential anomalies models along with a set of forecasting models to produce an accurate ensemble forecaster.
